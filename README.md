# Book Shelf BE app
This is my small projects for a backend basic study club in my university.
In this app, I use express js and nanoid for getting a book's id. All the books data will be stored in a array in a separate file.

## Getting Started
1. Download the dependencies by running `npm install`
2. The array will be always empty everytime you run/refresh it, so start with adding some book's data.
